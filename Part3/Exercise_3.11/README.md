## [Assignment](https://courses.mooc.fi/org/uh-cs/courses/devops-with-docker/chapter-4/multi-host-environments#5a8df1b3-50a7-4ef4-bbe7-00eb7033444e)

> **EXERCISE 3.11: KUBERNETES**
> 
> Familiarize yourself with Kubernetes terminology and draw a diagram describing what "parts" the Kubernetes contain and how those are related to each other.
> 
> You should draw a diagram of at least three host machines in a Kubernetes cluster. In the diagram assume that the cluster is running two applications. The applications can be anything you want. An example could be a video game server and a blog website.
> 
> You may take inspiration from the diagrams of [Chapter 3](https://courses.mooc.fi/org/uh-cs/courses/devops-with-docker/chapter-3/volumes-in-action).
> 
> The applications may utilize other machines or APIs that are not part of the cluster. At least three of the machines should be utilized. Include "your own computer" in the diagram as the one sending instructions via kubectl to deploy an application. In addition, include a HTTP message coming from the internet to your Kubernetes cluster and how it may reach an application.
> 
> Make sure to label the diagram so that anyone else who has completed this exercise, and read the glossary, would understand it. The diagram should contain at least four of the following labels: Pod, Cluster, Container, Service and Volume. I prefer to use [draw.io](https://draw.io/) for diagrams, but you can use whichever tool you want.
> 
> See the Kubernetes [Glossary](https://kubernetes.io/docs/reference/glossary/?fundamental=true), and have a look at some [helpful diagrams](https://tsuyoshiushio.medium.com/kubernetes-in-three-diagrams-6aba8432541c)
> 
> As the answer submit the URL where the diagram can be found.
